# Bōkendokei Project Overview

## Project Purpose

Bōkendokei is a habit-tracking app that makes forming habits fun through gamification. Users are "Adventurers" who have "Pals" (low-resolution sprite characters) that change appearance based on mood and achievements.

## Core Concepts

-   **Adventurers**: Users who log challenges and track progress
-   **Pals**: Animated sprite characters that represent the user's mood and status
-   **Party**: Groups of adventurers (e.g., family members)
-   **Challenges**: Tasks that earn Gold when completed
-   **Adventure Journal**: Mood tracking and personal updates

## Technical Stack

-   **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
-   **Backend**: Supabase (planned for Auth, Database, Storage)
-   **Build Tool**: Turbopack for development
