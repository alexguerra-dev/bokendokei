## 1. **App Purpose & Vision**

Habits are hard to form. Let this make starting fun.

---

## 2. **MVP Features (Core)**

- The _must-have_ functions that allow the app to fulfill its core purpose.
- Each should be written as a **user story**:

  - _As a \[user type], I want to \[do something], so that \[benefit]._

Example:
_As a registered user, I want to log in with email so I can access my saved data._

---

## 3. **Future Features (Nice-to-Have)**

- Ideas for things to add once the MVP is working.
- Can include stretch goals, integrations, advanced UI, etc.

---

## 4. **UI / UX Notes**

- General design language (rounded vs. sharp corners, color palette, font choices).
- Layout sketches (even text-based).
- Accessibility considerations (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast).

---

## 5. **Technical Stack Decisions**

- Frontend: React + Next.js + Tailwind
- State management: (React Query? Zustand? Context?)
- Backend: Supabase (Auth, Database, maybe Storage)
- Persistence: what data needs to be saved and where
- API patterns (REST vs GraphQL vs Supabase RPC)

---

## 6. **Data Model**

- Entities and relationships.
- Example: `User`, `Post`, `Comment` with fields like `id`, `createdAt`, etc.
- This guides Supabase schema.

---

## 7. **Open Questions**

- Uncertainties you still need to decide on.
- Keeps track of blockers without derailing flow.
