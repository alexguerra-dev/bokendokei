When you do something _positive_ you get some kind of reward.

Reward Ideas

- GP (gold pieces, sometimes coin or gill)

I like the ideas that a child can get something to trade in for an item of there choice.

What are _rewardable_ things?

- Good Turn (Tell the family about doing your daily good turn)
- Brushing Teeth
- Putting away laundry
- Evening Reading

I don't want to have a life meter. I think that is far too stressful.

## Shops

- Outfits
- Pets
-

There always needs to be some sort of member or user system to keep track of individual's information

There should probably be some user rolls.

- Admin (Parent)
- Child
- Idle Board (The thing on the screen most of the time)
  - I am kind of thinking it should be a line up of 4 tamagachi type creatures
    - Dark background
    - Down light and little shadow below each character
